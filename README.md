# Simple ChatBot with JSON Memory

This is a simple chatbot that learns from user input and stores questions and answers in a JSON file. If the chatbot doesn't know an answer, the user can teach it, and it will remember the response for future conversations.

---

## Features üöÄ
- Loads questions and answers from a JSON file.
- Finds the closest matching question using `difflib`.
- If no answer is found, it prompts the user to teach the bot.
- Saves new questions and answers automatically.
- Supports quitting the conversation by typing `"quit"`.

üîó [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Clone or Download the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatbot-json.git
cd chatbot-json
```

### 3. Create a JSON Data File
Ensure you have a `data.json` file in the same directory. If it doesn't exist, create it with the following structure:
